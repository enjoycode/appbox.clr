** Class:  StringBuilderCache
**
** Purpose: provide a cached reusable instance of stringbuilder
**          per thread  it's an optimization that reduces the 
**          number of instances constructed and collected.
**
**  Acquire - is used to get a string builder to use of a 
**            particular size.  It can be called any number of 
**            times, if a stringbuilder is in the cache then
**            it will be returned and the cache emptied.
**            subsequent calls will return a new stringbuilder.
**
**            A StringBuilder instance is cached in 
**            Thread Local Storage and so there is one per thread
**
**  Release - Place the specified builder in the cache if it is 
**            not too big.
**            The stringbuilder should not be used after it has 
**            been released.
**            Unbalanced Releases are perfectly acceptable.  It
**            will merely cause the runtime to create a new 
**            stringbuilder next time Acquire is called.
**
**  GetStringAndRelease
**          - ToString() the stringbuilder, Release it to the 
**            cache and return the resulting string
